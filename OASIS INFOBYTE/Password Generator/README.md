üìçPassword Generator : 

üí°Explanation of the Code

This Python script creates an advanced password generator using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to customize their password based on several options and copy it to the clipboard.
1. Import Statements:

    - tkinter: Used to create the GUI.
    - messagebox and simpledialog: Provide dialogs for user interaction (error messages, input prompts).
    - random and string: Used for generating random passwords.
    - pyperclip: Used to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

2. Password Generation Function (generate_password):

    - length_var.get(): Retrieves the desired password length from the user input.
    - uppercase_var.get(): Checks if the user wants to include uppercase letters.
    - numbers_var.get(): Checks if the user wants to include numbers.
    - symbols_var.get(): Checks if the user wants to include special symbols.
    - exclude_var.get(): Retrieves characters that the user wants to exclude from the password.
    - The function then creates a character set based on the user's selections and generates a random password of the specified length.
    - The generated password is displayed in the password entry field.

3. Clipboard Function (copy_to_clipboard):

    - pyperclip.copy(password): Copies the generated password to the clipboard.
    - A message box confirms that the password has been copied.

4. GUI Setup:

    - root = tk.Tk(): Initializes the main application window.
    - Widgets: Labels, entry fields, checkboxes, and buttons are created and placed within the window to allow user interaction.
    - The application runs in a loop waiting for user input.
