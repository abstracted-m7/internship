üìçWeather Detection :

üí°Explanation :

This Python script creates a weather application using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the requests library to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current weather information.
1. Import Statements:

    - tkinter: Used to create the GUI components (like windows, labels, buttons).
    - messagebox: Displays pop-up messages, such as errors or warnings.
    - requests: Handles HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

2. OpenWeatherMap API Configuration:

    - API_KEY: Your unique API key from OpenWeatherMap. Replace this with your own key.
    - API_URL: The base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API.

3. get_weather(city, units) Function:

    - Sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the specified city and unit parameters.
    - Parameters:
        city: The city name entered by the user.
        units: Either 'metric' for Celsius or 'imperial' for Fahrenheit.
    - If the request is successful, it returns the weather data as a JSON object. If there's an error (e.g., the city is not found), it shows an error message and returns None.

4. display_weather(data, units) Function:

    - Parameters:
        data: The weather data returned from get_weather.
        units: The unit of measurement for temperature ('metric' or 'imperial').
    - Extracts relevant information from the data (like city, country, temperature, weather description, and wind speed).
    - Formats and displays the weather information in the GUI. If no data is available, it informs the user.

5. fetch_weather() Function:

    - Retrieves the city name from the input field.
    - Calls get_weather to fetch the weather data.
    - Calls display_weather to update the GUI with the fetched data.
    - Ensures that the user has entered a city name before attempting to fetch the data.

6. GUI Setup:

    - root = tk.Tk(): Initializes the main application window.
    - Widgets:
        An entry field for the user to input the city name.
        An option menu to select the temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
        A button to trigger the weather data retrieval.
        A label to display the fetched weather information.
    - The application runs in a loop waiting for user input.

üöÄ Usage :

    - Running the Application:
        Run the script using Python. The main application window will appear.

    - Getting Weather Information:
        Enter City: Type the name of the city for which you want to retrieve the weather.
        Select Units: Choose either Celsius or Fahrenheit as the temperature unit.
        Get Weather: Click the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the weather information for the entered city.

    - Viewing the Results:
        The application will display the city's weather, including the temperature, weather conditions (e.g., cloudy, sunny), and wind speed. If the city is not found or there's an error, an appropriate message will be shown.

    - This simple weather application is a useful tool for quickly checking the weather in any city. It demonstrates how to interact with an external API and build a user-friendly interface.
