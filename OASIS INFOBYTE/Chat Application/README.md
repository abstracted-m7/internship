📍Chat Box :

💡Explanation of the Code

This Python script is a basic chat application that can operate in either server or client mode. It uses the socket library for networking and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).
1. Server-Side Logic:

    - handle_client(client_socket, clients, nicknames): Handles communication with an individual client. It listens for messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients. If the client disconnects, it removes them from the list of active clients.
    - broadcast(message, clients): Sends a given message to all clients in the clients list.
    - start_server(host='127.0.0.1', port=12345'): Sets up the server, waits for clients to connect, and assigns each client to a separate thread using handle_client.

2. Client-Side Logic:

    - ChatGUI(client_socket): Defines the client's GUI using Tkinter. It includes a chat area for displaying messages and an entry field for sending messages.
    - write(event=None): Sends the message typed by the user to the server.
    - receive(): Continuously listens for incoming messages from the server and displays them in the chat area.
    - on_closing(event=None): Handles the closing of the GUI window, ensuring the client disconnects properly.
    - start_client(host='127.0.0.1', port=12345): Connects the client to the server and launches the chat GUI. The user is prompted to enter a nickname, which is sent to the server.

3. Main Execution:

    - The script asks the user whether they want to run the application as a server or client.
    - Server Mode: Starts listening for client connections.
    - Client Mode: Connects to the server and starts the chat GUI.

🚀Usage

    - Starting the Server:
        Run the script and type server when prompted.
        The server will start listening for client connections on the specified IP address (127.0.0.1) and port (12345).

    - Starting a Client:
        Run the script and type client when prompted.
        Enter a nickname when asked. The chat GUI will appear, allowing you to send and receive messages.
        Multiple clients can connect to the same server, enabling group chat.

    - This basic chat application can be expanded with additional features like user authentication, multimedia sharing, and more.
