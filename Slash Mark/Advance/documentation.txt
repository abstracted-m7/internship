**Project Documentation: Airline Reservation System**
Project Overview

The Airline Reservation System is a Java application designed to manage flight reservations. It allows users to view available flights, book and cancel flights, and view booking details. The system uses CSV files for persistent data storage of flights and bookings.

    Display Available Flights: Shows a list of available flights with details such as flight number, airline, origin, destination, and available seats.
    Book a Flight: Allows users to book a flight by providing passenger details (name, email, phone number, PAN card, address, and ZIP code).
    Cancel a Booking: Enables users to cancel a flight booking by providing the passengerâ€™s name and PAN card.
    Display Booking Details: Shows details of all bookings or a message if no bookings are available.

    Display Available Flights:
        Iterate through the list of flights and print details.
    Book a Flight:
        Verify flight availability, book a seat, and add the booking.
        Save updated data to CSV files.
    Cancel a Booking:
        Find the booking by passenger name and PAN card, remove it, and update seat availability.
        Save updated data to CSV files.
    Display Booking Details:
        Print booking details or a message if no bookings are available.
    Exit System:
        Close resources and terminate the application.
