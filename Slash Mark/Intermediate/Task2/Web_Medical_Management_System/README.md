#Project_Overview :-
#Name : Virtual Medicine Home - Web Medical Management System

The Virtual Medicine Home is a Java-based web medical management system designed to facilitate the efficient management of medical services, patient records, and doctor-patient interactions within a healthcare facility. This system provides a centralized platform for administrators and doctors to manage essential healthcare tasks, including adding and viewing doctors and patients, scheduling appointments, and connecting patients with potential organ and blood donors.
Key Features

    #1. Admin Module:
        - Add Doctor: Allows the administrator to add new doctors to the system by providing details such as ID, name, and specialization.
        - View Doctors: Enables the administrator to view a list of all registered doctors along with their details.

    #2. Doctor Module:
        - Add Patient: Doctors can add new patients to their list, capturing important information such as ID, name, and ailment.
        - View Patients: Doctors can view a list of patients assigned to them, ensuring that all patient details are easily accessible.

    #3. Patient Interaction: The system supports online appointment scheduling, enabling patients to book consultations with doctors remotely.

    #4. Healthcare Connectivity: The system facilitates connections between patients and potential organ and blood donors, enhancing the chances of successful transplants and life-saving procedures.

Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to streamline medical management processes within healthcare facilities. By providing a digital platform for administrators and doctors, the system aims to reduce paperwork, improve efficiency, and ensure that patient care is managed effectively. This system is particularly beneficial for hospitals, clinics, and healthcare centers that require a robust solution for managing medical records and appointments.
Technology Stack

    - Language: Java
    - Libraries: Standard Java Libraries (e.g., java.util, java.io)
    - Tools: Java Development Kit (JDK), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

Future Enhancements

    - Database Integration: Implementing persistent storage using databases like MySQL or MongoDB to manage larger datasets.
    - User Authentication: Adding a secure login system for administrators, doctors, and patients to ensure data privacy and security.
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI): Transitioning from a command-line interface to a more user-friendly GUI using JavaFX or Swing.
    - Appointment Reminders: Implementing a notification system to remind patients and doctors of upcoming appointments.
