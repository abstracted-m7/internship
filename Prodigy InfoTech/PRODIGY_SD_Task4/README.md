`Sudoku Solver Algorithm`

    1. Initialize the GUI:
        - Create a 9x9 grid of entry fields using Tkinter to allow the user to input a Sudoku puzzle.
        - Add a "Solve" button to trigger the solving process.

    2. Input Validation:
        - When the user enters a number in any cell, validate the input:
            - Ensure the input is a number between 1 and 9.
            - If the input is invalid, clear the cell and highlight it in red.

    3. Extract Board State:
        - Upon clicking the "Solve" button, extract the current state of the board from the entry fields:
            - Convert each valid number to an integer.
            - If a cell is empty, represent it with a 0.

    4. Check Board Validity:
        - Before attempting to solve, ensure the initial board configuration is valid:
            - For each non-empty cell, temporarily clear the cell and check if placing the number there is valid - according to Sudoku rules:
                - The number must not be repeated in the current row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
            - If the board is valid, proceed to solve the puzzle; otherwise, display an error.

    5. Solve the Sudoku Puzzle (Backtracking):
        - Use a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle:
            - Start from the first cell (0,0) and attempt to place numbers from 1 to 9.
            - For each number, check if it's safe to place it in the current cell (row, column).
            - If placing the number is safe:
                - Place the number and move to the next cell.
                - If a solution is found, return True.
                - If placing the number leads to a dead-end (no valid numbers can be placed in future cells), - backtrack by resetting the cell and trying the next number.
            - If no valid number can be placed in the current cell, return False to trigger backtracking.

    6. Display the Solution:
        - If the Sudoku puzzle is solved, update the GUI with the solution by filling in the grid with the solved numbers.
        - If the puzzle is unsolvable, display an error message indicating no solution exists.

    7. Terminate the Program:
        - Once the solution is displayed or an error message is shown, the user can either close the program or modify the puzzle and try again.

Key Points of the Algorithm:

    - Input Validation ensures that the user cannot input invalid numbers.
    - Board Validity Check ensures that the puzzle input by the user is solvable.
    - Backtracking is the core of the solving process, efficiently exploring possible solutions by placing numbers and backtracking when necessary.
    - User Feedback is provided throughout the process, helping to guide the user and prevent errors.
